            Using vanilla inject function requires you to store references to injected components turning `bard.inject('mapNavigationService')` into this:

            ```js
            let mapNavigationService;

            beforeEach(inject(_mapNavigationService_ => {
                mapNavigationService = _mapNavigationService_;
            }));
            ```

            Here we only inject mapNavigationService as it doesn't have any other dependencies.
